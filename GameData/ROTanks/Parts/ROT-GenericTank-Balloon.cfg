	@title = Modular Balloon Tank
	@description = This modular tank allows for many customizations. You can integrate top and bottom adapters, adjust the length and the diameter as well. Balloon tanks are expensive and complex as they need to be pressurized at all times, but they are much lighter than regular tanks. These are similar to tanks used on the Atlas and Centaur stages. <b><color=green>Min Utilization: 99% - Max Utilization: 100%</color></b>
