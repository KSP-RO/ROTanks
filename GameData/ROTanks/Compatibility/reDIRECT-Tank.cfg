	description = This modular tank allows for many customizations. You can integrate top and bottom adapters, adjust the length and the diameter as well. It is comprised of many different tank types. You can choose the tank type below. Each tank type has a different base mass, different cost, and different amounts of utilization it can have. The HP versions of the tanks are Highly Pressurized and are used for engines that require it.
